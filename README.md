# AppProject
*Purpose:*

   An application originally developed on iOS to help users log nutrition, diet, and workout routine as it pertains specifically to Powerlifting. A centralized nutritional application geared towards powerlifting. Help users track personal progress and improve on the three main lifts: Bench Press, Deadlift, Squat. 
   
*Introduction:*

   Fitness enthusiasts often use general fitness-based apps to help improve various aspects of fitness, such as nutrition, workout routine, and macro content in one's diet. However, there are never any good applications geared towards the niche of powerlifting. With this application, we wanted to create something similar to the various fitness apps already on the market, but geared specifically towards being a powerlifting tracker, to allow a gateway for the niche of powerlifting. 

   We want to include the user's workouts and progress in their routine through various means, such as logging the sets, repetitions, and weight lifted through every workout. The user would input their progress into a daily log, and the application would track the user's daily progress, offering various charts and data to help show progression and trends throughout a period of time.

   With said user-inputted progress and application generated charts to help show data and progression, we also want to expand and offer a separate page to give users suggestions, tips, and advice towards issues that many powerlifters struggle with throughout their fitness journey. Whether it be lifting form, workout intensity, or even simply maintaining consistency, we hope to supply the user with database-generated advice and video suggestions. Through the suggestions page, we hope the user is able to implement new tips and tricks into their training regimen, further advancing their progression towards the next step of their fitness powerlifting journey. 

   Whether it be a new personal record lift, competition bodybuilding goals, body aesthetic, or simply powerlifting as a hobby, we hope to provide the user with a centralized platform in order to help the user learn, gain knowledge, and then apply it to the betterment of themselves. 

*Components:*

   This application was developed on XCode 11 using Swift 5.1. We implemented the Calendar framework and allowed users to input data such as workout routines through the utilization of CocoaPods. The database that we implemented was Firebase. We used Firebase to help us implement a realtime database for users to store information on the calendar and also look for advice, tips, and/or suggestions regarding the world of powerlifting. 

   To view the project and the current progress, feel free to check out this Github! On it, you should be able to view the application in its entirety and track what we've been able to accomplish and achieve as we phase towards preparing to release our product onto the iOS App Store. 

*Conclusion:*

 Due to the ongoing pandemic, we decided to pivot towards the creation of this application in order to reconnect with our active lifestyles in the gym. Born as a hobby between three colleagues, being able to powerlift and pursue an active lifestyle at the gym became a sacrifice that had to be made in order to stay safe amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, due to our technical background, we were all able to come together and rekindle our love for powerlifting through the development of this application.

   Developing an application became the best way to enhance our technical abilities such as UI/UX, Programming, and Product Management. Such a project allowed us the ability to not only enhance our technical knowledge and expertise, but also maintain socially distancing guidelines and ensure everyone's safety from the ongoing pandemic. 

   We were not only able to enhance our technical skills and expertise, but also were all able to come together to work as a team, helping to enhance various soft skills that are often overlooked. Through collaboration, all members worked together to enhance our communication skills, teamwork, time management, and refocus our drive towards becoming successful as we enter post-grad and focus on becoming successful in our respective professional careers. 

   Hopefully once COVID-19 subsides, we can be able to use this application in its entirety by going to the gym and inputting our workout routines and dietary nutritional progress. Until then, however, we hope to refine this application and push it towards the iOS App Store and into the market for the general consumer to use. This project has been rewarding through our newly found connection to an active lifestyle and also the refinement of our technical capabilities.
